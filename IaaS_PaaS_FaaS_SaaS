Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned, and managed over the internet.
IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity 
of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure.
