Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned, and managed over the internet.
IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity 
of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure.

Platform as a service (PaaS) allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing underlying application infrastructure.
You manage the applications and services you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.

Option Function as a Service (FaaS)  - Function as a Service (FaaS) or Azure function is a serverless implementation, provides a runtime 
environment to execute code, written in any language the user is comfortable. Functions are ideal when you're only concerned with the code 
running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.

Option Software as a Service (SaaS) - Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet.
Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

Option Serverless computing is incorrect - Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring or maintaining a server. 
The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action. Few examples of Serverless applications
on Azure are Logic apps, Functions, Service Fabric.

SAS
When you are implementing a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, you are responsible for configuring the SaaS solution. 
Everything else is managed by the cloud provider.
SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools
(such as Microsoft Office 365).
SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.
You rent the use of an app for your organization and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser.
All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider's data center.
The service provider manages the hardware and software and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability 
and the security of the app and your data as well.
