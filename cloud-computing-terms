Option Fault tolerance - Fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. 
Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. 
This type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.

Option High availability - High availability is the ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime. 
Workloads are typically spread across different virtual machines to gain high throughput, performance, and to create redundancy in case
a service is impacted due to an update or other event.
