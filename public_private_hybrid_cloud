Public cloud is a computing service offered by third-party providers (eg. Azure) over the public Internet, making them available to 
anyone who wants to use or purchase them. You can migrate your resources to the public cloud, and decommission your datacenter. 
Public clouds can save companies from the expensive costs of having to purchase, manage, and maintain on-premises hardware and application infrastructure.
