A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a query. In the simplest case, you can think of a view as a window on specified 
rows in an underlying table. For example, you could create a view on the Orders table that lists the orders for a specific product.





Option index - An index helps you search for data in a table. 
Think of an index over a table as an index at the back of a book. A book index contains a sorted set of references, with the pages
on which each reference occurs. When you want to find a reference to an item in the book, you look it up through the index. You can
use the page numbers in the index to go directly to the correct pages in the book. Without an index, you might have to read through 
the entire book to find the references you're looking for.



Option heapt - A heap is a table without a clustered index.
One or more nonclustered indexes can be created on tables stored as a heap.
Data is stored in the heap without specifying an order. Heaps can be used as staging tables for large, unordered insert operations.
Because data is inserted without enforcing a strict order, the insert operation is usually faster than the equivalent insert into a clustered index.



Option stored procedure - A stored procedure is a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with an assigned name, which is 
stored in a relational database management system as a group, so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.
